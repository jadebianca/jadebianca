            <p class="paragraph">
                From the very start, her life seemed like a playground full of <em>tiny adventures and endless curiosity</em>. 
                Born on March 6, 2006, <strong>Jade Bianca Portillo</strong> was the first daughter, niece, and granddaughter in her family. 
                Even as a toddler, she was <strong>quiet but curious</strong> about everything, which often left her parents stressed trying to keep up with her energy. 
                She learned to read and write at the age of three simply by watching videos, finding moving pictures interesting over books. 
                Her tiny hands would reach for crayons and markers to draw anything that came to her mind, often decorating her notebooks and even the walls of their home. 
                Boredom sometimes turned her into a little mischief maker, such as cutting her own hair when no one was watching her. 
                One time, she pricked her little finger on her grandmother’s sewing machine just to see if she would also fall asleep like Princess Aurora. 
                Despite being a mischievous child, she had a soft spot for her first cat, Ringring, who became her loyal companion and secret keeper. 
                She spent countless hours sharing stories and secrets with him, knowing he would never tell them to anybody. 
                Unlike most Filipino children who liked playing outdoors, Jade Bianca preferred exploring and playing with technology with her family. 
                She loved watching cartoons and YouTube videos on her parents’ phone and played PS3 and Nintendo Switch with her younger sister and cousins. 
                Often, she would accompany her aunt to the internet cafe to play online games while her aunt was doing her school work. 
                She sometimes observed her parents work as virtual assistants and asked endless questions about their work. 
                She also gained basic knowledge of MS Word, PowerPoint, and Excel through watching video tutorials. 
                Her creativity and curiosity also led her to explore new things. 
                At school, she started as a shy and average student, but she gradually stepped out of her comfort zone when she was in fifth grade. 
                She started participating in competitions inside and outside the schools, such as journalism, poster making, and spelling bees. 
                She was not only active in competitions but also actively participating in class, and because of this, she graduated from <strong>Plainview Elementary School</strong> with flying colors. 
                Every little experience shaped her adventurous and curious little mind. 
                Jade Bianca’s childhood was a mix of <strong>mischief, creativity, learning, and endless discoveries</strong> that made her who she was becoming.

            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Her teenage years brought a new chapter of <strong>growth and self-discovery</strong>. 
                Jade Bianca started her high school journey at <strong>Rizal Technological University</strong>, slowly uncovering more about herself. 
                As she adjusted to her new environment, she met friends who understood her quiet and observant nature. 
                These friends became her lifelong friends, allowing her to feel accepted. 
                With this sense of comfort, she remained the kind of friend who listened more than she spoke. 
                She believed that listening allowed her to connect with people on a deeper level. 
                Even though she was an introvert, she became more expressive with people she felt comfortable with. 
                Sometimes people often mistook her calm demeanor as intimidating, but in reality, she is very caring and thoughtful yet shy to openly show her feelings. 
                Over time, she started exploring new hobbies that shaped her identity. 
                Though her childhood dream was to become an architect because of her love for drawing, she later found an interest in learning more about technology. 
                Her computer subject during high school taught her basic web development and designing, hardware and software, and number systems. 
                Learning technology slowly became more than just an interest; it became a path she wanted to follow. 
                Wanting to improve her skills and also prepare herself for college, Jade Bianca chose the <strong>TVL - ICT</strong> strand for senior high school. 
                Through this path, she gained confidence in her skills and goals. 
                During her senior high school years, she also challenged herself. 
                She joined the student council for the first time as their strand treasurer. 
                There, she learned how to balance her duties and school work while discovering strengths she didn’t know she had. 
                Despite the pressures she received from people around her, she remained calm and determined. 
                By the time she finished high school, she not only graduated with flying colors but with pride and purpose. 
                As her high school journey came to an end, Jade Bianca realized how each small step she took helped shape her future.

            <p class="paragraph">
                College opened new doors to a new world, full of <strong>challenges and opportunities</strong>. 
                Just like a cat exploring unknown places, Jade Bianca approached this stage with the same curiosity she had since childhood. 
                She is currently an <strong>Information Technology</strong> student at the <strong>University of the East</strong>, a course she had dreamed of pursuing. 
                Although she didn’t get into her dream university, UE gave her a chance to achieve her goals. 
                This also encouraged her to continue chasing her goals with an open mind. 
                She promised herself to learn as much as she could without stressing over perfect grades. 
                For Jade Bianca, gaining true understanding matters more. 
                With this mindset, she attended every class with patience and interest. 
                Along the way, she met friends who shared the same goals to succeed, and they soon became close groupmates. 
                Their shared determination allowed them to support one another through challenging projects and deadlines. 
                Together, they learned, laughed and celebrated their small achievements. 
                Jade Bianca also discovered that she enjoyed subjects that involved handling and working with data the most. 
                Subjects like Information Management and Fundamentals of Database Systems sparked her curiosity even more. 
                This motivated her to work on every activity with diligence and eagerness to improve her skills and understanding. 
                Day by day, college strengthened her passion for technology. 
                The path she had chosen was not that easy, yet she stayed determined. 
                Every challenge became an opportunity for her to learn and grow. 
                She appreciated the slow but steady growth that came each semester. 
                With her curiosity guiding her, she continued exploring new ideas and skills. 
                Now, Jade Bianca dreams of becoming someone in the <strong>IT</strong> field, hoping to turn her interest into her future career.
