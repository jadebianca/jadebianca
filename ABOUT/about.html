      <h2 id="childhood">Childhood Years: Paws of Playful Curiosity</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        <sup>1</sup> From the very start, her life seemed like a playground full of <em>tiny adventures and endless curiosity</em>. 
        <sup>2</sup> Born on March 6, 2006, <strong>Jade Bianca Portillo</strong> was the first daughter, niece, and granddaughter in her family. 
        <sup>3</sup> Even as a toddler, she was <em>quiet but curious</em> about everything, which often left her parents stressed trying to keep up with her energy. 
        <sup>4</sup> She learned to read and write at the age of three simply by watching videos, finding moving pictures interesting over books. 
        <sup>5</sup> Her tiny hands would reach for crayons and markers to draw anything that came to her mind, often decorating her notebooks and even the walls of their home. 
        <sup>6</sup> Boredom sometimes turned her into a little mischief maker, such as cutting her own hair when no one was watching her. 
        <sup>7</sup> One time, she pricked her little finger on her grandmother’s sewing machine just to see if she would also fall asleep like Princess Aurora. 
        <sup>8</sup> Despite being a mischievous child, she had a soft spot for her first cat, Ringring, who became her loyal companion and secret keeper. 
        <sup>9</sup> She spent countless hours sharing stories and secrets with him, knowing he would never tell them to anybody. 
        <sup>10</sup> Unlike most Filipino children who liked playing outdoors, Jade Bianca preferred exploring and playing with technology with her family. 
        <sup>11</sup> She loved watching cartoons and YouTube videos on her parents’ phone and played PS3 and Nintendo Switch with her younger sister and cousins. 
        <sup>12</sup> Often, she would accompany her aunt to the internet cafe to play online games while her aunt was doing her school work. 
        <sup>13</sup> She sometimes observed her parents work as virtual assistants and asked endless questions about their work. 
        <sup>14</sup> She also gained basic knowledge of MS Word, PowerPoint, and Excel through watching video tutorials. 
        <sup>15</sup> Her creativity and curiosity also led her to explore new things. 
        <sup>16</sup> At school, she started as a shy and average student, but she gradually stepped out of her comfort zone when she was in fifth grade. 
        <sup>17</sup> She started participating in competitions inside and outside the schools, such as journalism, poster making, and spelling bees. 
        <sup>18</sup> She was not only active in competitions but also actively participating in class, and because of this, she graduated from <em>Plainview Elementary School</em> with flying colors. 
        <sup>19</sup> Every little experience shaped her adventurous and curious little mind. 
        <sup>20</sup> Jade Bianca’s childhood was a mix of <em>mischief, creativity, learning, and endless discoveries</em> that made her who she was becoming.

    <h2 id="teenage">Teenage Years: Whiskers of Discovery</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        <sup>1</sup> Her teenage years brought a new chapter of <em>growth and self-discovery</em>. 
        <sup>2</sup> Jade Bianca started her high school journey at <em>Rizal Technological University</em>, slowly uncovering more about herself. 
        <sup>3</sup> As she adjusted to her new environment, she met friends who understood her quiet and observant nature. 
        <sup>4</sup> These friends became her lifelong friends, allowing her to feel accepted. 
        <sup>5</sup> With this sense of comfort, she remained the kind of friend who listened more than she spoke. 
        <sup>6</sup> She believed that listening allowed her to connect with people on a deeper level. 
        <sup>7</sup> Even though she was an introvert, she became more expressive with people she felt comfortable with. 
        <sup>8</sup> Sometimes people often mistook her calm demeanor as intimidating, but in reality, she is very caring and thoughtful yet shy to openly show her feelings. 
        <sup>9</sup> Over time, she started exploring new hobbies that shaped her identity. 
        <sup>10</sup> Though her childhood dream was to become an architect because of her love for drawing, she later found an interest in learning more about technology. 
        <sup>11</sup> Her computer subject during high school taught her basic web development and designing, hardware and software, and number systems. 
        <sup>12</sup> Learning technology slowly became more than just an interest; it became a path she wanted to follow. 
        <sup>13</sup> Wanting to improve her skills and also prepare herself for college, Jade Bianca chose the <em>TVL - ICT</em> strand for senior high school. 
        <sup>14</sup> Through this path, she gained confidence in her skills and goals. 
        <sup>15</sup> During her senior high school years, she also challenged herself. 
        <sup>16</sup> She joined the student council for the first time as their strand treasurer. 
        <sup>17</sup> There, she learned how to balance her duties and school work while discovering strengths she didn’t know she had. 
        <sup>18</sup> Despite the pressures she received from people around her, she remained calm and determined. 
        <sup>19</sup> By the time she finished high school, she not only graduated with flying colors but with pride and purpose. 
        <sup>20</sup> As her high school journey came to an end, Jade Bianca realized how each small step she took helped shape her future.

      <h2 id="college">College Years: Leaping Towards Her Dream</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        <sup>1</sup> College opened new doors to a new world, full of <em>challenges and opportunities</em>. 
        <sup>2</sup> Just like a cat exploring unknown places, Jade Bianca approached this stage with the same curiosity she had since childhood. 
        <sup>3</sup> She is currently an <em>Information Technology</em> student at the <em>University of the East</em>, a course she had dreamed of pursuing. 
        <sup>4</sup> Although she didn’t get into her dream university, UE gave her a chance to achieve her goals. 
        <sup>5</sup> This also encouraged her to continue chasing her goals with an open mind. 
        <sup>6</sup> She promised herself to learn as much as she could without stressing over perfect grades. 
        <sup>7</sup> For Jade Bianca, gaining true understanding matters more. 
        <sup>8</sup> With this mindset, she attended every class with patience and interest. 
        <sup>9</sup> Along the way, she met friends who shared the same goals to succeed, and they soon became close groupmates. 
        <sup>10</sup> Their shared determination allowed them to support one another through challenging projects and deadlines. 
        <sup>11</sup> Together, they learned, laughed and celebrated their small achievements. 
        <sup>12</sup> Jade Bianca also discovered that she enjoyed subjects that involved handling and working with data the most. 
        <sup>13</sup> Subjects like Information Management and Fundamentals of Database Systems sparked her curiosity even more. 
        <sup>14</sup> This motivated her to work on every activity with diligence and eagerness to improve her skills and understanding. 
        <sup>15</sup> Day by day, college strengthened her passion for technology. 
        <sup>16</sup> The path she had chosen was not that easy, yet she stayed determined. 
        <sup>17</sup> Every challenge became an opportunity for her to learn and grow. 
        <sup>18</sup> She appreciated the slow but steady growth that came each semester. 
        <sup>19</sup> With her curiosity guiding her, she continued exploring new ideas and skills. 
        <sup>20</sup> Now, Jade Bianca dreams of becoming a <em>data analyst</em>, hoping to turn her interest into her future career.
